## üÜö **Git vs. GitHub: Understanding the Difference**

While **Git** and **GitHub** are closely related, they serve different purposes in the software development process. Let‚Äôs break down their key differences:

### **Git** üåê

- **What is Git?**  
  Git is a **distributed version control system (VCS)** that helps you track changes in your code over time. It allows you to maintain and manage different versions of your project, track history, and collaborate with others.

- **How Does Git Work?**  
  Git works locally on your machine, allowing you to:
  - Create branches to work on different features or fixes.
  - Commit changes to your local repository.
  - Merge code from different branches.
  - Track changes and revert to earlier versions of your code.

- **Key Features of Git:**
  - **Version Control**: Keeps track of code changes, and you can go back to previous versions if needed.
  - **Branching**: Create isolated environments to work on different tasks without affecting the main project.
  - **Distributed**: Every developer has a full copy of the repository.

### **GitHub** üåç

- **What is GitHub?**  
  GitHub is a **cloud-based platform** built on top of Git that provides a remote place to store and manage your Git repositories. It allows developers to collaborate, share code, and work on open-source projects together.

- **How Does GitHub Work?**  
  GitHub is used to:
  - Host Git repositories in the cloud.
  - Share your work with other developers and collaborate through pull requests.
  - Track issues, bugs, and feature requests for better project management.
  - Automate workflows using GitHub Actions.

- **Key Features of GitHub:**
  - **Collaboration**: Easily collaborate with others through features like pull requests, issues, and GitHub Discussions.
  - **Hosting**: Host your code in the cloud and access it from anywhere.
  - **Pull Requests (PRs)**: A way to propose changes to a repository and review code before merging it.
  - **GitHub Actions**: Automate your workflows, like building and deploying your applications.

### **Summary**

- **Git**: A version control system to manage and track changes in your code **locally**.
- **GitHub**: A cloud-based platform to **host** your Git repositories and collaborate with others.
