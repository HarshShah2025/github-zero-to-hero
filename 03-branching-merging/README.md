# 🌿 Git Branching & Merging: Mastering Branch Management

In this section, you’ll learn how to work with **Git branches** and how to **merge** them efficiently.

---

## 🔧 Key Concepts

### 1. **Branching** 🌱
- **Create a branch**: `git branch <branch-name>`
- **Switch to a branch**: `git checkout <branch-name>`
- **Create and switch**: `git checkout -b <branch-name>`

### 2. **Merging** 🔀
- **Merge branch** into the current branch: `git merge <branch-name>`
- Resolving merge conflicts: Handle conflicting changes and commit.

---

## 📚 Useful Tips
- **Branch names** should be descriptive (e.g., `feature/login`).
- Always **commit changes** before switching or merging branches.
- Use **`git merge --no-ff`** for a clean merge history.

---

## 💡 Best Practices
- Use branches for **features**, **bug fixes**, or **experiments**.
- Always **sync** your branches with `git pull` before merging.
- Review code before merging with **Pull Requests**.
